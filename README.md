GameEngine
==========

I developed this game engine using C++ over 2 years courses. This 3D game engine include networking (RakNet), AI, world editor (wxWidgets), graphics (data driven, deferred rendering), collision, audio (FMOD), fbx loader, ... The projects include Capture the Flag game build using the game engine.

Requirement:
- Visual Studio 2010
- DirectX SDK from June 2010 (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)

Before you run the game, make sure you build all the sub projects.

The renderer engine is built using DirectX 3D. I also wrote some shader:
- shadow
- normal mapping
- environment map
- soft intersecton
- alpha blending
- wobble effect
- post processing rendering
